'''
Task:
You are given a 2-D array with dimensions NXM. 
Your task is to perform the min function over axis 1 and then find the max of that.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains the space separated values of N and M.
The next N lines contains M space separated integers.

Output Format:
Compute the min along axis 1 and then print the max of that result.

Sample Input:
4 2
2 5
3 7
1 3
4 0

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
The min along axis 1 = [2,3,1,0]  
The max of [2,3,1,0] = 3
