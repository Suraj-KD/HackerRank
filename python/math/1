Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.
A complex number is completely determined by its real part  and imaginary part . 
If we convert complex number  to its polar coordinate, we find:
: Distance from  to origin, i.e., 
: Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive -axis to the line segment that joins  to the origin.
Python's cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers.
Task 
You are given a complex . Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.
Input Format
A single line containing the complex number . 
Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.
Constraints
Given number is a valid complex number
Output Format
Output two lines: 
The first line should contain the value of . 
The second line should contain the value of .
Sample Input
  1+2j
Sample Output
 2.23606797749979 
 1.1071487177940904
Note: The output should be correct up to 3 decimal places.
